        <h1>What is GitHub?</h1>
    </header>
    <p>Git is a collaborative open-source version control system </p>
    <p>This means a history of pushed changes make it easy to rollback/rollforward to easily make changes.</p>
    <p>This also make it easy to work with others as you can share code to work on the same project</p>
    <p>It makes use of branches, where you make 'alternate timelines' to test out code before pushing it to the main
        code.</p>
    <p>Anyone can create repositories where it gets stored on GitHub to back-up code or to share!</p>
    <p>You can use GitHub Pages to load html files like this.</p>

        <h1>General Workflow:</h1>
        <ol>
            <li>Create or find a Repositotry that you want to work on</li>
            <li>Copy link and clone it on a command line (git clone addressName) or download the files</li>
            <li>Check 'status' on the terminal (git status)</li>
            <li>Once you made any changes that you want to add to the main file, add your changes to the staging area:
            </li>
            <li>'addding' all files: (git add .) </li>
            <li>'commiting' with a meaningful message to the changes (git commit -m "inital commit") </li>
            <li>'pushing' (git push origin main) my changes to the main branch</li>
            <l1>If you want to test your changes by making another branch: (git checkout -b branchName)</l1>
            <li>After you make more changes, to the same from git add. then you can push your changes to the new branch
                (git push origin branchname)</li>
            <li>A Pull Request will be available to the host to accept those changes.</li>
        </ol>

        <h1>Workflow when attempting the tasks on the Tasks page:</h1>
        <ol>
            <li>Click on one of the links; it will take you to a GitHub Classrooms page.</li>
            <li>Click the green button on the screen to accept the assignment.</li>
            <li>Each task has their own challenges, but it is a good idea to look at the Read-Me file and the Worksheet.</li>
            <li>Go onto Gitpod using the green Gitpod button to start coding.</li>
            <li>If java is not downloaded in Gitpod, click on the 6th button from the top, on the left-hand side to open 'extensions' and download everything required for java </li>
            <li>Read the code and comment what you know. Some challanges ask you to predict what the output is.</li>
            <li>When you are finished with a task, save all your changes and push your code to your repository.</li>
            <li>A handy feature to look for is the 'Actions' tab on your repository. It is right next to 'Pull Requests'</li>
            <li>Click it, then click on your latest push.</li>
            <li>Don't be alarmed if it is red. This is to help highlight if you have done a tasks incorrectly.</li>
            <li>Look to the left-hand side and click on 'Java Code Tests' for an easier time reading where/what went wrong</li>
