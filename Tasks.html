    <h2>This page provides some coding tasks to guide you through certain topics. As a challenge, try to ask a friend to join you on these tasks.
    </h2>
    <p><b>Getting started with task 1: <a href="https://classroom.github.com/a/OcxSDbFy">Calculator.java</b> </a></p>
    <br>
    <p>This beginner task is to get you started with Java.</p>
    <p>Open the link and join the GitHub Classroom.</p> 
    <p>Open it with your favourite IDE by downloading it, or clone it, or use the GitPod that is built-in on the page.</p>  
    <p>Open the file junit-basics, src, main/java/x1n32, then Calculator.java.</p> 
    <p>It is a class that has methods/functions to manipulate numbers. Have a look at all the methods.</p>  
    <p>The task is in calculator2.java: Where you try to code how to calculate the quadratic formula.</p>  
    <p>A basic structure has been given. Don't try to change the method names, but you can change things </p>  
    <p>such as float, int, double, to see if it makes any difference.</p>  
    <p>Answers are in the Answer Branch. </p>  
    <p>Look at the commands page for git commands.</p>  

    <br>
    <p><b>Task 2: <a href = "https://classroom.github.com/a/Cai9Cb04">Data Structures </a></b> </p>
    <br>
    <p>This task builds upon the use of data structures in Java, such as Arrays, lists, and maps.</p>
    <p>The classroom link will provide you some code for you to look at.</p> 
    <p>This task is more broken up than the first, in that is a starter task to review key terms and predict code in the worksheet.txt</p>
    <p>Demo code has been provided to show how arrays and lists (linked and array) are made. </p>
    <p>After commenting and running it, your task is to extend/write/fix code in HashMapTask and Comic Book that uses HashMap</p>
    <p>As a challenge, make a new branch to write your code, and merge it to the main one when you think you are done.</p>
    <br>

    <p><b>Task 3:Design Patterns - decorator. Co Op task. Share and implement</b></p>
